# DICE-ROLL-SIMULATOR-GAME
This Python script simulates a dice-rolling game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 6, and wins or loses based on whether it matches the computer's randomly rolled dice.

# 🎲 Dice Roll Simulator Game – A Python Coder's Mini Adventure

## 📖 The Backstory

It all began on a rainy afternoon. I was sipping coffee and thinking:
**“What if I could recreate the thrill of rolling a dice... in code?”**

And just like that, the **Dice Roll Simulator Game** was born — not just a simple project, but a tiny adventure for anyone who loves luck, laughter, and a little challenge.

## 🎮 The Game

Imagine a magical dice that lives inside your terminal.
You, the player, try to guess the number it will land on.
Will it be a **3**, a **6**, or maybe that lucky **1**?
If your guess is right — you win and the dice dances in your favor.
If you're wrong — well, better luck next time... and don't cry, okay?

## 🧱 Behind the Scenes (aka How It Works)

I crafted this simulator using basic Python logic and a sprinkle of randomness:

1. **The Dice Faces:**
   I used a list of visual emojis (`🎲`) to represent each dice face — from one to six. Why? Because a little visual magic makes everything more fun!

2. **The Randomness:**
   The computer silently rolls the dice using `random.choice()`, while you boldly enter your guess (from 1 to 6).

3. **The Showdown:**
   Your guess meets the computer’s roll:

   * If you guessed right — **BOOM! YOU WIN! 🎉**
   * If you guessed wrong — **Oof. YOU LOSE! Try again! 🥶**

4. **The Scorekeeper:**
   Your score increases with every win, and decreases with every loss. Think of it as your luck meter. How high can you go?

5. **The Exit Plan:**
   Don’t worry — you're not trapped in an infinite loop of fate. Just type `'q'` to quit anytime, and the game politely asks if you're *really* ready to walk away.

Enter a number from 1 to 6 to roll the dice('q' to quit): 
4

🎲🎲🎲🎲
YOU WIN 😁😁😁
SCORE: 1

Enter a number from 1 to 6 to roll the dice('q' to quit): 
2

🎲🎲🎲
Computer_play: 3
YOU LOOSE 🥶🥶🥶

## 🧰 What You Need

* Python 3.x installed on your computer
* A keyboard and a little courage to face the dice

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Save the code in a file, say: `dice_game.py`
2. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
python dice_game.py
```

Then follow the prompts and let the dice decide your fate 🎲

## 💭 Final Thoughts

This wasn’t just a game I built — it was a way to turn simple Python skills into something **playful**, **interactive**, and a bit **addictive**.
A reminder that even in the world of logic and code, there’s always room for a little chance and charm.

**Play. Learn. Lose. Win. Laugh. Repeat.**
